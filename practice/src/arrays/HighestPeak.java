 * 
 * 	rules are:
 * 		height of any water cell is 0, height of any land cell
 * 		cannot differ fo rmore than once from any of the neighbouring (sharing one edge) cells.
 * 
 * 	 EG:
 * 		T F T
 * 		F F F
 * 		F F F
 * 
 * 	One possible map:
 * 		0 0 0
 * 		1 0 1
 * 		2 1 2 
 * 
 * 	and below map is  not possible (2 differs more than 1 from the neighbouring call)
 * 		0 2 0
 * 		0 0 0
 *  	0 0 0
